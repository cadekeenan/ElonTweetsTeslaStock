# ElonTweetsTeslaStock
If you follow technology, entrepreneurship, or space exploration, you more recently may have been introduced to Tesla or its CEO Elon Musk. Following Musk in the news, you might have noticed the pioneering capitalist tweets out whatever comes to his mind at a given moment, regarding his own companies, geo-politics, cryptocurrencies, and the occasional witty meme. Some of these tweets have come back to bite him in the form of large sellouts of Tesla shares. A fortune.com article shared that one single tweet from Musk on November 6, 2021, about selling a portion of his Tesla shares sent Tesla stock price plummeting by 7.3% in one day (Vercoe, 2021).    In this project, we intend to analyze the correlation between Musk’s tweets and the effect on the stock price of his company through his public opinion. We will use a dataset downloaded from Yahoo Finance to obtain stock price information, and we will use a Twitter API to download and import Musk’s tweets from Jan 1, 2019 – Jan1, 2022 into R. Finally, we will examine the relationship between the price of stock and tweets from Musk on a given day, week, month, etc.
