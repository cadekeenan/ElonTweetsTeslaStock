# ElonTweetsTeslaStock
If you follow technology, entrepreneurship, or space exploration, you more recently may have been introduced to Tesla or its CEO Elon Musk. Following Musk in the news, you might have noticed the pioneering capitalist tweets out whatever comes to his mind at a given moment, regarding his own companies, geo-politics, cryptocurrencies, and the occasional witty meme. Some of these tweets have come back to bite him in the form of large sellouts of Tesla shares. A fortune.com article shared that one single tweet from Musk on November 6, 2021, about selling a portion of his Tesla shares sent Tesla stock price plummeting by 7.3% in one day (Vercoe, 2021).
